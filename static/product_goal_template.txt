<ProductGoal>
Goal Statement*

As a product owner, I want to define a clear product goal so that the team has a shared understanding of what we are trying to achieve.

Description*

The product goal provides direction and focus for the team. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). The goal should align with the overall product vision and strategy.

Business Value / Rationale*

A well-defined product goal helps the team prioritize work, make better decisions, and measure progress. It also ensures that everyone is working towards the same objective.

Outline Tasks (optional)
- Define the product goal statement.
- Ensure alignment with product vision and strategy.
- Communicate the goal to all stakeholders.
- Break down the goal into actionable PBIs.
- Review and adjust the goal as needed.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the product vision and strategy, when the product goal is defined, then the team should have a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved and how success will be measured.
Given the product goal, when PBIs are created, then they should directly contribute to achieving the goal.
